**Overall Notes:**  
- The warehouse follows a **star schema pattern**: one fact table (`fact_sales`) connected to three dimension tables.  
- Surrogate keys are used throughout for consistency and efficient joins.  
- The `outliers` table is excluded from the main schema but supports workflow transparency and data quality management.
